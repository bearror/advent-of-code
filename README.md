# Advent of Code

> [!NOTE]
> Inputs are stored as text files in an `inputs` directory under each year using
> the same naming convention as the solutions, e.g. `2024/inputs/day01.txt`.
> Automation for downloading your own inputs isn't currently implemented. You
> can still run unit tests against example inputs without copying over your own
> inputs.
>
> See the [FAQ on copying] for context on why the inputs are in `.gitignore`.
