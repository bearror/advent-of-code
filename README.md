# Advent of Code

> [!NOTE]
> Inputs are stored as text files in an `inputs` directory under each year,
> sharing a naming convention with the solutions, e.g. `2024/inputs/day01.txt`.
> Tooling for downloading your own inputs isn't currently implemented. You can
> still run tests against example inputs without copying over your own inputs.
>
> See the [FAQ on copying] for context on why the inputs are in `.gitignore`.
